abstract = "Graphene oxide (GO) is a unique material that can be viewed as a single monomolecular layer of graphite with various oxygen-containing functionalities such as epoxide, carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups. When the GO is reduced with a suitable process, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) formed resembles graphene but contains residual oxygen and other heteroatoms, as well as structural defects. GO and rGO have been used in nanocomposite materials, polymer composite materials, energy storage, biomedical applications, and catalysis, and as a surfactant with some overlaps between these fields. In this chapter, their different uses and applications are described."

abstract = "The academic literature using graphene within the field of electrochemistry is substantial. Graphene can be fabricated via a plethora of routes with each having its own unique merits (e.g. cost, fabrication time, quality and scale) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is more often the material of choice for electrochemical sensors and associated applications due to its ease of fabrication and ability to be mass produced on the kilogram scale. This review overviews pertinent developments in the use of rGO as the basis of electroanalytical sensors (2016-2017); guidelines for the progression of this field are also given."

abstract = "The Ward error sum of squares hierarchical clustering method has been very widely used since its first description by Ward in a 1963 publication. It has also been generalized in various ways. Two algorithms are found in the literature and software, both announcing that they implement the Ward clustering method. When applied to the same distance matrix, they produce different results. One algorithm preserves Ward{\textquoteright}s criterion, the other does not. Our survey work and case studies will be useful for all those involved in developing software for data analysis using Ward{\textquoteright}s hierarchical clustering method.",
